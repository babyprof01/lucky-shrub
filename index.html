          <h3>Azalea</h3>

          <p>
            Azaleas are wonderful additions to the garden. They are easy to
            grow, look sensational, and have attractive foliage. Evergreen
            azaleas provide year-round interest while deciduous azaleas often
            have exquisite fall color and exhibit an elegant woody framework in
            winter. Azaleas do well in full sun or part shade (about four hours
            of sun). Planted in full sun, azaleas will be more compact and
            floriferous. When planted in part shade, they will stretch toward
            the sunlight and form a more graceful habit; flowers will not be as
            plentiful but will last longer.

          <h3>Camelia</h3>

          <p>
            The camellia is a flowering evergreen shrub with dark, glossy leaves
            and large, lush blossoms that appear and bloom for several weeks
            during the fall through early spring period in warmer regions. Where
            it is reliably hardy (zones 7 to 9), the camellia is a very popular
            plant that is used in much the same way that northern gardeners use
            peonies. Similarities between peonies and camellias include lushly
            petaled blooms and a tendency to outlive their owners Camellias can
            be planted from container-grown nursery plants at almost anytime of
            year except during the hottest summer months. They are slow-growing
            but exceptionally long-lived plants.

          <h3>Weigela</h3>

          <p>
            Weigela (pronounced why-GEE-luh) is one of those spring flowering
            shrubs. In spring, this beauty bursts into bloom with pretty,
            tubular-shaped flowers in shades of pink. Hummingbirds can't resist
            the blossoms, so plant weigela if you want to attract these lovely
            pollinators to your garden. Best of all, weigela is bulletproof â€”
            easy to grow and pretty tough.
